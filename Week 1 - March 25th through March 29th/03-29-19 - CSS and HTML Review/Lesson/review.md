## Review

We've covered a lot of topics this week and have done a lot of work in class. This will probably be one of the easier weeks though depending on how you look at it. Most (but not all) Fridays will be a chance for review and a chance to ask questions. This week is no different.

If you feel like you've got all the topics so far, feel free to move on to the in class work. If not, ask away!
