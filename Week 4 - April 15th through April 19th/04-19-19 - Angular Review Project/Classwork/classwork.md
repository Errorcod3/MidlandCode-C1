## Classwork 04-19-19

You have a couple options of what to do in class.
1. Finish any styling and functionality needed for your todo app - Group or Solo (OPTIONAL)
2. Working with a group, create a new app for a fictitious company/product. Utilize everything you've done so far to make it a fully fledged item. This should include the ability to login, update data via a service, use a directive (custom or otherwise) add animations, styling, etc. Work together form a single repo and assign work to tbe completed to allow for full work. When working from the same repo ensure that you all understand the scaffolding of your project.
3. Review anything with customized work.
4. Start working on the weekend's homework to get help as needed.
