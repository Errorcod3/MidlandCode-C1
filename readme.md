# General Syllabus - Code Academy

## General Overview - 

Below is a general layout for each of the weeks and what to expect going in. While the specific structure of a day might change depending on subject complexity or review needed, the topics slated for a week will not (new topics might be added though depending on speed of comprehension). All of the topics listed for a week will be taught in the listed week and as such, you are encouraged to reach out for any assistance needed. 
In addition to the class instruction, most weeks will include either a field trip to a local business/coding group/etc. to help build your network and/or a workshop on improving your soft skills and resume. While we have specific times to focus on these things, we strongly encourage you to ask any questions about how to grow your brand and/or network throughout the entirety of the course.
It is important to remember that this is an intensive course and there will be a lot of information taught. One of the most important things you can learn is to ask for help when you need it, not after the fact. All of the faculty associated with the Code Academy is there to support you so do not hesitate to reach out whenever you need the help.

## General Week Overview

Each week will consist of five class days of topics that will be (generally) structured as follows:
* __Morning__ – Review from previous day and new topics introduced. This will consist of both instruction via live examples and hands on practice. The ratio will depend upon the complexity of the topics to be taught.
* __Lunch Break__
* __Afternoon__ – Review from the morning and in class work and examples. 

There will also be time to work on the daily homework depending on review needs / complexity of that day’s topics.
Fridays will serve (for most weeks) as a review of all weekly topics and further class work as needed. In addition to the in-class work, each Friday will have a larger homework assignment to be completed over the weekend and reviewed the following Monday. This homework will encompass all topics that were covered in the week. There will be time on Friday to ask any questions pertaining to the homework as well as time towards the end of class to be able to work it. In addition to the above, every Friday will consist of a group lunch with Brock to discuss how the class is going and if there are any issues to be brought up. The lead instructor will not be present for this lunch as it is meant to be a free and open discussion about anything regarding the class.

# Useful Reference 

## HTML Elements

### Semantic Elements -
If you're going to use semantic elements for part of your page, I recommend using them throughout the entirety of the project. 

* Main - Any Main content usually one per page
* Aside - Any content to the side like a glossary, usually one per page
* Header - Any sort of header, can be page header or section header
* Footer - Any sort of footer, can be page footer or section footer
* Nav - Any navigation menu, top menus or sub menus can use these
* Section - Any Section, usually inside a main. Second least used of these for me.
* Article - Usually a sub section of Sections, least used of these for me.

### Most Used Tags and Their Most Used Attributes
Most used for pretty much all elements are `class`, `id`, and `style`. Below will be the most used elements as well as any element specific attributes outside of the above three. If no additional attributes are listed, the main three are the only ones generally used
* `<div></div>` - Containers in lieu of or addition to Semantic Tags
* `<a></a>` - Used for internal or external links. `href` allows for the actual url or id to be linked to
* `<img>` - Used to add images to the page. `src` allows for a url of the image to be loaded
* `<ol></ol>` or `<ul></ul>` - Creates ordered (numbered) or unordered (bullet pointed) lists.
    * `<li></li>` - List items contained in one of the lists above.
* `<form></form>` - Parent form container for any form elements
* `<label></label>` - Label for any form elements. `for=""` allows the label to link to a form element.
* `<input>` - Input elements. 
    * `type=""` - Determines the kind of input. Can be `text`, `radio`, `checkbox` `password` or others.
    * `name=""` - Declares the name of the input for use in sending the information to the server. Needs to be the same across all shared `radio` or `checkbox` types to ensure the form works correctly.
    * `placeholder=""` - Determines a placeholder to start in the input allowing better user experience.
    * `value=""` - Sets the default value for the input. Should only be used to help with auto-fill.
* `<button></button>` - Allows for a button to display
