## Variable Practice
* Familiarize yourself with object traversal. 
* Build an object with at least 3 layers deep of objects and practice logging to console.
* Declare different variables of different types and practice those.

## Loop Practice
* Run through all numbers from 1-100. 
    * If the number is divisible by 2 log the number and "Fizz" 
    * If the number is divisible by 3 log the number and "Buzz" 
    * If the number is divisible by 2 AND 3 log the number and "FizzBuzz"
* Take an input from the user. Starting with the 4th character, log all characters until the end of the input. If the input is shorter than 4 characters, nothing should be logged.
* Pick a random number. Prompt the user to guess a number. If the number is correct, end the loop and tell the user how many tries it took to guess. If it is incorrect, continue the loop. (Test functionality by logging the number that was randomly generated in the prompt).
* Using nested for loops, create and log the following pattern:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```
* Simulate a coin flip. Start a counter at 0. If the initial flip was heads, leave the counter at 0 and log: "It took 0 retries to get heads!". If the coin was tails, try again and keep doing so until heads happens. Log the amount of retries it took.

## Comparison Practice
* Build a simple site that prompts a user for their first name and then a number between one and one-hundred (inclusive).
    * Tell them whether their number is odd or even and if its greater than, or less than/equal to 50 and then log those messages separately to the console. 
    * Log if it is divisible evenly by both 5 and 3 (log no message if it is not).
    * Log every number before theirs and every number from 100 counting down to theirs in two separate loops.
    * If their name is your name send an alert saying that it is a great name
    * Otherwise send an alert saying "Hi (their name)" 
    * then log their name in reverse to the console.
    * Bonus: 
        * Allow their full name to be entered as case insensitive and only use their first name. i.e if they entered "mike truax" and your name was "Mike" it would still match. 
        * Do this without the use of any extra if conditionals (don't just say name == "Mike" || name == "mike").
        * Also have a contingency in place if they enter a number outside of the range.
        * Do all of the above only using either of the "if" or "else" keywords once each in your program (this would require things not covered in class)
* Take the following arrays: `[-1,-2,2,10,7,8]` and `[4,-2,2,7,9,5]` and see how many items the two arrays share in common. Do this without prototypical functions. This will also require the use of loop(s)
* Practice with the differences between `==` and `===`

## Object Practice
* Build an object with at least 3 layers deep of objects and practice logging to console.
* Practice building new objects from existing objects WITHOUT allowing for the objects to be equal.
