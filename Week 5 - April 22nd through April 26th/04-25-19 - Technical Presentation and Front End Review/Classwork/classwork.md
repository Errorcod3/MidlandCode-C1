## Mini Project!

We will be building a mini project. This can be something that will continue work we already have done or will start from scratch.

You will be randomly grouped into groups of 3 and decide what you will be working on. You'll have 20 mins to decide and then start working after clearing the project with me. At MINIMUM it should have the following:

* API consumption
* Auth Guards with at least one protected generic and one protected user route.
* A form with no less than 3 elements and form control
* Use of interfaces
* Use of at least one resolver
* User signup and login
* Use of at least 3 components.
