## Classwork 04-08-19

* Taking the pictures in this folder as a starting point, edit the classes and styling in `MediaQueries.html` according to the instruction in it. 
* As a class we will come up with a layout for a fictitious site. We will then take that basic design and break into small groups. The groups will then come up with how to design the page to look good at different screen sizes and put it into practice. Each team will then discuss with the class why they chose the breakpoints and layout changes they did.
